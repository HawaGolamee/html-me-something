                           I arrived in St. Louis, Missouri, United States on January 2019. It is almost going to be two years. I learned a new way of living life. I come to know new cultures, new education system, and many other new things. 
                           The most I like of here is that the people are friendly and kind. Here people support and work hard to build up their society. Moreover, St. Louis has many beautiful places like Botnical Garden, Arch, and many good 
                           local and State parks for picnic points.
